# Project Details
  Content Based Product Recommendation System. Project carried out for the Startup 'Search-In IT Solutions LLP'.
  
# Objective
  Building a product recommendation system based on the logic of Cosine Similairty that works best on the products found in the     Database.

# Working
  Recommendation systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to user based on many different factors.
  Recommendation system recommends you the items based on past activities this is known as Content Based Filtering.
  The Idea used in this project is Content Based filtering.
  
# Algorithm
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. 
  Mathematically it calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional space. 
  Cosine similarity is advantageous when two similar documents are far apart by Euclidean distance (size of documents) chances     are they may be oriented closed together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
