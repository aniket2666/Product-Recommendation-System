# Product Recommendation System
  Repository of the project on content based product recommendation system using ML algorithm carried out on Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.

# Objective
  The main objective of the project is to build a product recommendation system that works based on the content in      the database and recommends similiar products.

# Algorithm
  The model is based on the well known algorithm - 'Cosine Similarity' . Here, the products are grocery items in string fromat .
  The strings are then transformed to vectors using Tf-Idf Vectorization method. 
  The vectors are the best inputs for the algorithm which gives out input in the form of a recommendation
